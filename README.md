## Introduction
Built and deployed an advanced Restaurant, Attraction, and Hotel Discovery Application using Google Maps. With Geolocation, Google Maps API, Searching for places, Fetching restaurants, hotels and attractions based on location from specialized Rapid APIs, data filtering and much more, this Travel Advisor App is the best Maps Application that you can currently find on YouTube and on the entire internet.

By building this application I explored and learned aspects such as:

- Advanced React Best Practices such as folder & file structure, hooks and refs
- Creating a User Interface using Material UI
- Working with Google Maps API
- Fetching data from unlimited sources using RapidAPI

Setup: run ```npm i && npm start``` to start the development server
